# interviewQs
A collection of some technical and non-technical interview questions that I've been asked over the years...and there's a good few of them unfortunately!<br>
I'm also including some questions that I reckon might be potential candidates (excuse the pun) questions for interview and have marked them as *(a PCQ)*.<br>
Each section may have one or more **sub-section**, for example, there is a **Spring** section under the **Java** heading - ah, you get the idea.<br><br>
Please feel free to use them if you want to and if you've got a few juicy ones then add them!
